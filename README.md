Odin Project Tic Tac Toe in-browser game
Instructions for this project can be found at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript

Todo: need to take players current arrays from Gameboard object and plug them into evaluateScore().
Styling needs to be touched up. Would like to impliment area for players to put their names in.
Would also like to put in a game round system with ongoing scoreboard.
Eventually would be cool to tie in to twitter API.
